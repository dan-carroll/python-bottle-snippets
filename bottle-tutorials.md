# Bottle Tutorials
Simple list of some vetted tutorials and my thoughts on their efficacy.

## [The Official Bottle Tutorial](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html)
This tutorial introduces you to the concepts and features of the Bottle web framework and covers basic and advanced topics alike.

## [To-Do List Tutorial](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html)
This tutorial should give a brief introduction to the Bottle WSGI Framework. This tutorial is a work in progress and written by [noisefloor](https://noisefloor-net.blogspot.com/).

## [Developing with Bottle by Real Python](https://realpython.com/developing-with-bottle-part-1/)
Basic tutorial with install directions for a unix (linux) system and multiple routes, or pages. The second part is more interesting and involves the plot.ly API.
